= Course: Optimizing vLLM Performance

== Introduction to vLLM Performance Optimization

Welcome to the course on vLLM Performance Optimization. Now that you know how to deploy and benchmark a model, it's time to tune its performance for real-world production workloads. This course focuses on maximizing inference efficiency using vLLM tuning techniques that can dramatically improve latency and throughput without requiring additional hardware.

=== Why Performance Optimization is Critical

* **User Experience**: Sub-second response times, especially Time to First Token (TTFT), are essential for interactive applications like chatbots and coding assistants.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Better performance means serving more users with the same infrastructure, directly reducing the cost per request and improving ROI.
* **Scalability**: Optimized models can handle higher concurrent user loads without performance degradation, ensuring a reliable service.
* **Resource Utilization**: Proper tuning maximizes GPU utilization, ensuring you get the most value from your expensive hardware.

By the end of this course, you will be able to systematically tune key vLLM parameters, measure the impact of your changes, and configure a model for optimal performance based on specific use case requirements.
