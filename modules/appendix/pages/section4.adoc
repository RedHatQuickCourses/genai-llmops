= Course Wrap-up

Congratulations! You have successfully optimized a vLLM deployment by tuning its core parameters and leveraging the power of quantization. You have moved beyond simply deploying a model to engineering a high-performance inference service.

=== Summary of Learnings

What You Accomplished:

* **Established a Baseline**: You learned to use GuideLLM to create a repeatable performance baseline, which is the first step in any optimization effort.
* **Mastered Key Parameters**: You gained hands-on experience tuning `max-model-len` and `max-num-seqs`, understanding their direct impact on memory usage, queuing, and latency.
* **Applied Quantization**: You deployed a quantized model and quantitatively proved its significant performance benefits over the full-precision version.
* **Developed a Methodology**: You practiced a systematic approach: **measure, tune, validate, repeat**. This methodology is applicable to any performance optimization task.

=== Business Impact and Next Steps

The skills learned in this course directly translate to business value by reducing infrastructure costs and improving user experience. When a customer is facing high latency or escalating GPU costs, you now have a proven playbook to diagnose and solve their problems.

Your optimization foundation is also a prerequisite for more advanced techniques. The performance baseline you establish is essential for measuring the impact of quantization (as we saw) and other methods like speculative decoding.

You are now equipped to deliver end-to-end performance improvements that fundamentally change the economics and user experience of LLM deployments.
